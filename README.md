# Introduction
As lake temperatures worldwide increase and ice duration decreases among Northern lakes, understanding the biogeochemistry and microbiology under ice is crucial to determine how nutrient cycling occurs and how it may change in the future. One cycle experiencing dynamic changes is the nitrogen (N) cycle. Collectively, we are becoming aware of the importance of nitrogen cycling during winter, yet relatively few studies have investigated microbial communities and their activities under ice. 

# Objective 1: Time-series dynamics
We are analysing a five year time series of metagenomic data, of samples collected in Lake Mendota from 2008 to 2012. We are focusing on the MAGs which are affiliated with known bacteria taxa involved in the key transformations of the Nitrogen Cycle. The goal is to understand how the abundance of these bacteria changes over time, and at which point in the year do they show "blooming". Furthermore, we want to understand the phylogenic diversity of these bacteria in freshwater lakes.

# Objective 2: Incubation experiment
During winter 2018, we sampled Lake Mendota throughout the water column (5,10,15,20,22,23m) and accross time. For each sampling trip, we collected environmental variables, collected samples for bacterial sequencing (16S rRNA, and eventually metagenomics), and for incubation experiments.
## Sequencing:
TBD
## Incubations:
Depth-discrete water samples representative of the oxic and anoxic layers of the lake was incubated at room temperature, and supplemented with labelled 15N nitrogen species. We collected water from these incubation at several time points (each week), and performed a series of biochemical analyses including 
(a) Photospectrometer to measure absorbance to quantity ammonia concentrations 
(b) Gas-chromatography Mass-Spectrometry (GC-MS) to track 15N isotopomers (28N, 29N, 30N), which serve to quantify rates of nitrification, denitrification and anammox activity 
(c) High-performance liquid-chromatrography (HPLC) to measure NO2 and NO3.
